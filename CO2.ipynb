Therefore, 5000 ppm seems like a good guess for A. $B$ is a timescale over which the solution changes by a factor of $e$, which is roughly three. Therefore, at $t=B$ the solution should be about 1/3 of the way between the starting point and plateau. 500 secs looks pretty good to me. This is the reasoning that leads to the guesses I use below."
